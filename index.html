                Joey is a wannabe code enthusiast from Markham, Ontario. Originally a student of forestry, Joey quickly found that today's political situation turned all the entry-level forestry jobs into unpaid internships. Joey now spends his time working at a bank and trying to break into the world of tech.
                <br><br>
                Joey's major accomplishments include finishing his Masters in Forest Conservation, contributing to the City of Toronto's ravine management plan, learning how to make pasta from scratch, and finally deadlifting 3 plates after 10 months of working out.
                <br><br>
                When not working, Joey enjoys fun things such as hiking, rock climbing, being snobby about vinyls and craft beers, live music, video games, board games, being a dog father, cooking, and running a <a class="Instagram" href="https://www.instagram.com/staybloated/" target="_blank">food Instagram</a>. Joey is much more interesting in real life, or so he tells everyone else.
